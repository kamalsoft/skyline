# Skyline Weather Dashboard - User Manual

Welcome to Skyline! This guide will help you get the most out of your personal weather dashboard.

## 1. Introduction

Skyline is a modern, visually-rich weather dashboard that provides detailed local weather forecasts, world clocks, and a highly customizable interface. With animated backgrounds that reflect the current weather and time of day, Skyline offers an immersive and beautiful way to stay informed.

## 2. Getting Started

### Initial Setup

When you first launch Skyline, it will automatically attempt to determine your location to provide an accurate local weather forecast. You may be prompted by your browser to allow location access.

- **If successful:** Your local weather will appear on the main dashboard.
- **If it fails:** Skyline will load a default location (e.g., Chicago) and display a notification. You can then set your primary location manually through the **Settings** panel.

## 3. The Dashboard

### Main Weather Card

This is the central element of your dashboard. It displays:

- **Current Conditions:** Temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, wind speed, and Air Quality Index (AQI).
- **AI Summary:** A brief, human-readable summary of the day's weather.
- **Hourly Forecast:** A scrollable 24-hour forecast. Click on any hour for more details.
- **Weekly Forecast:** A 7-day forecast. Click on any day for more details.

### World Clock Sidebar

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the World Clock sidebar.

- **Add a Clock:** Go to `Settings > General` and use the search bar to find and add new cities.
- **Reorder Clocks:** Simply click and drag any clock to a new position in the list.
- **Remove a Clock:** Hover over a clock and click the 'x' icon that appears.
- **Collapse/Expand:** Use the arrow icon at the top of the sidebar to collapse it for a more focused view.

## 4. The Settings Panel

Click the **Settings** button on the bottom-left of the screen to open the main settings panel.

### General

- **Manage World Clocks:** Add or remove world clocks.

### Appearance

## 5. Troubleshooting

**Location is incorrect or not found.**

> If geolocation fails, Skyline loads a default location. You can set your primary location manually in `Settings > General`. You can also set a "Default Location" which will be used as a fallback.

**Animations are slow.**

> The animated background can be resource-intensive. You can disable specific animations in `Settings > Effects` to improve performance.

**I want to start over.**

> Go to `Settings > Data` and click the "Hard Reset" button. This will clear all your stored data, including clocks and settings, and restore the application to its initial state.
